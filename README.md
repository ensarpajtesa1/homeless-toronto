# Toronto Homelessness Analysis

On every political party's agenda is the topic of affordable housing, shelter and homelessness. In this report we will analyze the shelters provided for individuals experiencing homelessness and assess whether provided shelter meets demand. Data is refreshed daily on the Open Data Toronto to record information on all shelters provided within the geographic boundaries of the City of Toronto. Shelter occupancy is full to near full consistently and in need of additional expenditure to meet demand.

This repo is formatted as such:
inputs - raw data
outputs - paper and references
